# RPiEmulatorManager

This is a basic tool for running QEMU commands to emulate RaspberryPi
devices with varying operating systems with short easy commands.

This is a work in progress, and it is currently incomplete and a bit
messy.

Currently, there is only configuration for NetBSD as that was relevant
to what I was working on the time of developing this, but other
operating systems can be manually added through commands.
